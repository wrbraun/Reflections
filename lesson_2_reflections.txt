What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git generates a .git file, which will contain the status information
I need to do it to generate that file.

The commands I used were
- git init to create the repository
- git status to see what is in it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
it is an interim location for files
it allows to select the files to be placed in the repository
